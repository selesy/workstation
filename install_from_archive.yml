# File: install_from_archive.yml

# These plays download and install an application distributed as an
# archive.  Set the appropriate variables as follows:
#
# Required variables:
# -------- ---------
# 
# key:          The application's key.  This value will determine the
#               name of the directory (in /opt) where the application
#               is finally installed.
#
# title:        The application's formal name.
#
# version:      This value indicates what version should be downloaded
#               and is generally set in the "workstation_versions.yml"
#               file and copied within the task's vars file.
#
# url:          The URL where the application's installation archive can
#               be downloaded.
#
# Optional variables:
# -------- ---------
#
# checksum:     The URL of the file containing a checksum for the archive
#               which will be downloaded by this playbook.
#
# archive_path: If the archive includes a path prefix for each file, This
#               value allows the archive to be "relocated" to a directory
#               named by the version.  If this variable is empty, the
#               archive path is assumed to be ".".
#
# desktop_file: If the application has a GUI, this variable should point
#               to a template that will be completed and copied to
#               /usr/share/applications.  If this variable is empty,
#               no templating is performed.
#
# executables:  A list of the executables that should have symlinks placed
#               into /usr/bin.  If this variable is empty, no symlinks
#               are created.
